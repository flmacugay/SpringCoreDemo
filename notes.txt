1. idref in spring is to pass the id of a bean to another bean. This id must be string. And there must a bean with that name. It ensures at deployment time that bean with that name exists otherwise it will throw error.
2. spring bean scopes singleton and prototype applies only to the object's properties. Other objects within the class has their own scope. 
3. aware interfaces are called before bean post processors
4. Spring doesn't call destroy methods on prototype beans.
